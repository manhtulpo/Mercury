Changelog for Mojolicious-Broker

{{ $NEXT }}

0.014     2017-08-07 14:20:52-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed POD formatting errors. Thanks @manwar!

0.013     2017-08-03 22:06:22-05:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed the link to the broker command in the documentation. Thanks
      @arcanez

    [Added]

    - Added a regular ping for all connected clients. This should make
      Mercury faster to detect broken connections and destroy them.

0.012     2017-01-12 19:28:59-06:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Fixed allow_origin.t test failing on new versions of Mojolicious
      due to an invalid assumption in the test. Previously it was
      accidentally working, now it is deliberately working. Thanks
      @eserte for the report! [Github #37]

0.011     2016-12-17 21:09:31-06:00 America/Chicago

    [Fixed]

    - Default inactivity timeout is now 4 hours instead of 20 minutes.
      This makes it less likely that your subscribers will lose their
      connection to the broker unexpectedly.

0.010     2016-12-08 18:03:45-06:00 America/Chicago

    [Added]

    - /pub/*, /push/*, and /bus/* can now accept POST requests to post
      new messages to the appropriate subscribers. This allows any
      random HTTP client to send messages (but not receive them, yet)
